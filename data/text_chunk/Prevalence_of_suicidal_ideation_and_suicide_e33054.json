Results: Of 1277 identified records, 38 studies met the eligibility criteria. Suicidal ideation assessment was conducted using two instruments: the Beck Scale, which assesses lifetime suicidal thoughts, showing a prevalence of 14.09   (95   CI: 11.39 17.02  ), and item 9 of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), which evaluates death thoughts in the past two weeks, with a prevalence of 19.18   (95   CI: 12.65 26.69  ). Suicide attempts, evaluated by time frame, showed a prevalence of 7.06   (95   CI: 4.35 10.35  ) for \"lifetime\" and 4.45   (95   CI: 2.62 6.71  ) for the \"past 12 months. \" Temporal"
