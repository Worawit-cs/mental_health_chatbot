There has been increased concern about university\nstudents’ mental health in recent years, with a wide range of non-specific anxiety rates reported worldwide in under-\ngraduate university students. We aimed to explore prevalence of non-specific anxiety in undergraduate university\nstudent populations. Methods Four databases were searched to identify studies published between 1980 and 2020 which investigated\nprevalence of non-specific anxiety in undergraduate university students. Each study’s quality was appraised using a\nchecklist. Sub-analyses were undertaken reflecting outcome measure utilized, course of study, location of study, and\nwhether study was before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 89 studies – representing approx. 130,090 students—met inclusion criteria."

Eighty-three were\nincluded in meta-analysis, calculating a weighted mean prevalence of 39.65% (95% CI: 35.72%—43.58%) for non-spe-\ncific anxiety. Prevalence from diagnostic interview studies ranged from 0.3%-20.8% 12-month prevalence. Prevalence\nvaried by outcome measure used to assess non-specific anxiety, the type of course studied by sample, and by study\nlocation.
