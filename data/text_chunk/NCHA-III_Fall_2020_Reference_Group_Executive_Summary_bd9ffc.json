The ACHA-NCHA now\nprovides the largest known comprehensive data set on the health of college students, providing the college health and higher\neducation fields with a vast spectrum of information on student health. ACHA initiated the original ACHA-NCHA in 2000 and the instrument was used nationwide through the Spring 2008 data\ncollection period. A revised survey, the ACHA-NCHA-II, was in use from Fall 2008 - Spring 2019 data collection periods. The survey was redesigned again, and data collection with the ACHA-NCHA III began in Fall 2019."

The ACHA-NCHA III is programmed differently than earlier versions of the survey. Rather than asking the\nrespondents to answer every question (and offering a \"not applicable\" option), display logic was used throughout the survey to\ndetermine whether, based on their response to an earlier question, the student saw a follow-up question. This makes the valid\npercents of certain questions impossible to apply to the entire sample, as the denominator used was limited to only the number\nof students that saw the question."
