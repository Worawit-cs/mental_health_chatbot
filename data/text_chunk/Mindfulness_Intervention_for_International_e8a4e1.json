However, still providing the intervention content in the participant’s\nchosen language might increase the efficacy of the intervention further. Therefore, a\nfuture definitive trial might consider offering the same intervention in different languag­\nes to choose from and might adapt the intervention based on parsimonious social and\ncultural features. Fourth, this feasibility trial used a WL control group. As expected, trials\nof culturally adapted face-to-face mental health interventions with a WL group resulted\nin higher effect sizes, compared to an active control condition (d = 0.53 vs d = 0.47) (Soto\net al., 2018). This is also true for IMI (Sommers-Spijkerman et al., 2021)."

Assessment dropout was 35% in total,\nwhich is in accordance with the previous research (Nilsson et al., 2004). Possible reasons\nfor this may include a lack of monetary incentives, procrastination, and the typical work­\nload of student life."
