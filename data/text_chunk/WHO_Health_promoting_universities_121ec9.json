It was geographic in its focus, environ-\nmental in its emphasis and mechanistic in its thinking – the driving\nforce being the sanitary idea with its concern to separate human and\nanimal waste from food and water.

On reflection there is probably no ideal time, but\nthe expectations of the project need to be set within the context of the\norganization in relation to its own changes. THE FUTURE: CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES\nDuring the course of the Project, a framework of multifaceted inter-\nventions, using a variety of methods was developed, based on the\nhealth-promoting college model (4) to help clarify the areas that\nshould be covered by the Project (Fig. 3). This framework was pre-\nsented to the new Vice-Chancellor in January 1997. Further funding has been secured for the next phase of the Health\nPromoting University Project."
