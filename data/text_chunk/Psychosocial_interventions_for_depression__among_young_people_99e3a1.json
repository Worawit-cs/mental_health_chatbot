Conclusion Psychosocial interventions, particularly CBT, significantly reduced depressive symptoms among young\npeople in SSA. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the high heterogeneity which likely stems from variations\nin study populations and intervention delivery modalities. This highlights the need for further research to identify\nthe specific intervention components and delivery methods that work best for distinct subpopulations. Future\nresearch should also explore how long intervention effects are maintained and factors affecting efficacy."
