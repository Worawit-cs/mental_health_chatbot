Digital mental health interventions, such as\nthose delivered via the Web and apps, offer the potential to improve access to mental health treatment. Objective: This study aimed to review the literature on digital mental health interventions focused on depression, anxiety, and\nenhancement of psychological well-being among samples of college students to identify the effectiveness, usability, acceptability,\nuptake, and adoption of such programs."

Approximately half of the studies (45, 51%) did\nnot present any usability or acceptability outcomes, and few studies (4, 4%) examined a broad implementation of digital mental\nhealth interventions on college campuses. Quality assessments revealed a moderate-to-severe risk of bias in many of the studies.
