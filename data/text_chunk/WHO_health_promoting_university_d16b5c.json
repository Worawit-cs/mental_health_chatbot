The credit for the renaissance of public health and for the rise of what has come to be known as the new public health is shared by a range of critics who challenged the ascendancy of what was seen as a reductionist and deficient approach to the existential dilemma of life, health and death (2 7). Of particular importance was McKewan s analysis of the decline of deaths and infectious diseases in England and Wales between 1830 and 1970, which showed that most of the decline in 6 Context deaths from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis in England and Wales occurred before any specific prevention or treatment was"

The emergence of the settings-based approach, then, has been in- fluenced by a range of developments within health promotion, public health and environmental and social policy. It has increasingly been guided by a recognition that health gain2 can be most effectively and efficiently achieved by investing outside the health care sector. Inter- ventions in a range of social systems in ways that take account of the processes of personal, organizational and political development are essential for improving the health of populations (17). The first and best known example of settings-based health promo- tion is Healthy Cities (18). Beginning as a small WHO project in 1987 with the aim of taking the rhetoric of health for all and the"

Beginning as a small WHO project in 1987 with the aim of taking the rhetoric of health for all and the Ottawa Charter  off the shelves and into the streets of European cities  (19), Healthy Cities rapidly expanded to become a major global movement (18). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw parallel initiatives take root in a number of smaller settings. These initiatives included the Health Promoting Hos- pitals project, coordinated by the European Office of WHO (20), and the Health Promoting Schools project (Ziglio, E.

For instance, the growing interest in organiza- tional development and management of change within Healthy Cities has emerged out of the experience of cities seeking to introduce new ways of working in sectoral and compartmentalized structures.

A holistic and socioecological understanding of health A holistic, positive (salutogenic) and socioecological model of health promotion takes account of the dynamic interaction between personal and wider environmental factors in determining health and recognizes that the settings in which people live, work and play have a key deter- mining role in their health.

The Dean liked this idea, as he was concerned already about apparently high levels of alcohol consumption among medical students and felt that the development of a health promotion initiative might be one way of tackling this problem.

First we set up a steering group drawn from participants present at the initial brainstorming meeting to oversee the initiative as a whole.

Divergent health promotion paradigms Throughout the development of the initiative, there has been tension between two divergent health promotion paradigms (7). The Steering Group espoused a positive and socioecological paradigm   derived from the WHO strategy for health for all (8 10); the Faculty Board largely supported a more biomedically based disease prevention para- digm, with a strong focus on individual behaviour and lifestyle.

Nevertheless, ideas for progress in this area were hampered by perceived organizational barriers. At Lancaster all colleges depend on bar profits to finance other welfare activities. In the light of other organizational issues, the issue of bar profits was too sensitive to address at that time. 82 Case studies Provision of social spaces Alongside the debate around alcohol on campus, the group vigorously pursued providing a new location for meeting"
