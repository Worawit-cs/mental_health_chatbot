At the beginning of SNEHA in 1986, suicide was a subject tainted with social stigma. The going was initially tough as the\nconcept of volunteerism, emotional support and suicide prevention was poor – so much so that finding a place to rent was\ndifficult. Slowly and steadily the work of SNEHA came to be recognized by the public, media and mental health professionals. Over the decades, SNEHA branched out beyond being a suicide helpline to raising awareness in the community, addressing\npolicy issues and developing innovative community interventions to reduce suicides. In the early 2000s, SNEHA volunteers\nbegan noticing that every year in June, the number of callers increased."
