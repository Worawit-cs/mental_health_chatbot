Tsouros\nINTRODUCTION\nThe strategy and operation of the WHO Healthy Cities project offer a\nuseful framework for developing health-promoting university projects.\nThis chapter outlines the strategy and operations and provides insight\nand guidance for strategies for implementing such projects.\nThe concept of the health-promoting university is powerful. The\nchallenge is to give it, from the very start, a broad and strategic scope,\nobjectives that reflect the philosophy and principles of health for all\nand sustainability and tools that are appropriate for a settings-based\napproach to health promotion.

One of the most important aspects of\nthe settings-based approach to health promotion is that it creates proc-\nesses that enable many new actors and systems encouraging initiative,\nparticipation and creativity to contribute. Perhaps the most difficult\nbarrier to overcome is the tendency to perceive health only as the ab-\nsence of disease, unhealthy behaviour or the application of safety stan-\ndards. The new public health movement inspired by the strategy for\nhealth for all and the experience with health-promoting settings such\nas the healthy city and the health-promoting school and hospital have\ngenerated a climate that is much more favourable to change than was\nthe climate a few years ago."
