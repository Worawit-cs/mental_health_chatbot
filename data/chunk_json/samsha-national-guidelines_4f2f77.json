When asked\nwhat or who she credits for her recovery, Veronica doesn’t hesitate to say ongoing MAT and\ncaring recovery coaches, but, she lowers her voice, her colleagues don’t know. She fears they\nwouldn’t accept her and she has good reason to think so. “There’s a lot of stigma within the\nrecovery world and a belief that MAT is simply substituting one drug for another.” Veronica says\nin a recent discussion, a colleague said just that. “It’s startling because no one would say that\nabout a person with a physical illness. Can you imagine if those in the medical field said to people\nwith diabetes, ‘You shouldn’t use insulin as treatment.’ Well, that’s what’s happening in the field"

In May 2017, Dr. Tom Price, former\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, said, “If we’re just substituting one opioid for another,\nwe’re not moving the dial much.” He faced immediate backlash from the medical and scientific\ncommunity.

She says that\nwithout MAT, she would likely be dead. “I would have continued using, or relapsed, unsure of\nwhat I was taking and the dosage. Heroin is no longer pure.

I think that’s why they aren’t sympathetic.”\nLast year, Veronica’s 29-year-old half-sister died of endocarditis from intravenous drug use.\nHaving shared similar struggles, Veronica believes she and her sister ended up on divergent paths\nbecause of money and stigma. “My sister went to the nearest clinic for two years, and she did\nwell, but then she could no longer pay the $80 a week it costs to go to the clinic.” Her sister’s\nfamily refused to help with the fees because they thought taking Methadone would limit her job"

Am I\nliving a lie? I don’t think they would accept me. From what I’ve heard them say, my guess is it\nwould diminish their respect for me.
