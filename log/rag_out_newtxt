Answer: Based on the context provided, the term "suicide" is discussed primarily in relation to prevention strategies. Key points from the context include:

*   Making lethal means of suicide less easily available can reduce suicide rates by providing individuals in distress time for acute crises to pass.
*   Limiting access to the means of suicide is a universal evidence-based intervention.
*   A specific focus is placed on banning highly hazardous pesticides, which are estimated to account for one fifth of all suicides globally.
*   Most people who engage in suicidal behaviour experience ambivalence, and many suicides happen impulsively in response to acute stressors.
