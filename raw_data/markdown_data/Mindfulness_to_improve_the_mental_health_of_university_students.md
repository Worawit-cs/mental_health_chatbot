weekfor8weeks.Morretal.(45)reportedasignificanceofp =
0.006whileRitvoetal.(48)foundnodifferences(p=0.31).
Studies measuring anxiety with the Depression, Anxiety and
StressScale-21DASS(DASS-A)examinedinterventionsof8weeks,
but had contradictory results: Song and Lindquist (41) found
significantchanges(p=0.023)at120minperweek,whileGallego
etal.(47)hadsignificantfindingswithinterventionsshorterthan
60min per week (p = 0.480). During this same period, Li et al.
(44) used the ACS-anxiety and had favorable results (p = 0.001)
for 150min per week. This was in opposition to Yuan et al. (46)
whousedtheSelf-ratingAnxietyScaleSASandhadnosignificant
results(p=0.01)withshortersessions(30min).Thisindicatesthat
longersessionsweremoreeffective,regardlessofhowmanyweeks
theinterventiontakesplaceover.
Another variable addressed was psychological distress.
Different scales were used. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)
(39,40)wasusedandboth90min(39)ofinterventionfor5weeks
(p = 0.002) and 120min (40) per week for 8 weeks (p = 0.03)
were found to be statistically significant. Over the same period,
Galanteetal.foundthat90-minsessionswereeffectiveusingthe
Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (p = 0.001) (31).
Deshpandeetal.(43)usedthePsychologicalDistressCounseling
Center Assessment of Psychological Services (CCAPS-34) and
foundthatsessionsof150minhadasignificanteffect(p=0.001),
while De Vibe et al. (35) found a more statistically significant
result(p=0.021)for7weeksofmanagementfor90minusingthe
GeneralHealthQuestionnaire.
In addition, other related variables in the study, such as
attention and cognitive awareness (CAMS-R), were analyzed but
nosignificantdifferenceswerefoundbetweenthegroups.Although
the regulation of emotions was evaluated as a key factor in the
study,heterogeneitywasobservedintheconditions,measurements
and instruments used, which excluded it from the meta-analysis.
However,significantimprovementsintraitemotionalintelligence
were found in favor of the experimental group, with a small
effect size (η2 = 0.045 p = 0.04) (34). Regarding the regulation
of specific emotions, it was observed that the mindfulness group
showedsignificantlygreaterparticipation(meandifference=5.33)
compared to the re-evaluation group (mean difference = 4.61, p
< 0.01) and the suppression group (M = 3.86, p < 0.001) in
the regulation of sadness. However, despite the positive effect of
mindfulnessondecreasingsadness,thesuppressionapproachwas
foundtobeassociatedwithsignificantlyloweraveragesadnessover
theentireregulationperiodcomparedtomindfulness(p=0.002)
(38).Theseresultsindicatethatthemindful-nessinterventionhad
