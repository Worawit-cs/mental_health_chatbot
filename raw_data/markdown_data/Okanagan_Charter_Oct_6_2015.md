OKANAGAN CHARTER: AN INTERNATIONAL CHARTER FOR HEALTH PROMOTING UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
We acknowledge this Charter was developed on the territory of the
Okanagan Nation.
This land doesn't belong to us. This land belongs to seven generations down the
road. I pray that the water that we drink, the water that we swim in, will be
there for our great great great grandchildren. As well as all over the world. I
pray that the land that we walk on, the trees that we enjoy, will be there for our
generations to come. These things, they all come together with health. Health of
humans. Health of the animals. And health of the Mother Earth.
- Closing Prayer by Okanagan Nation Elder, Grouse Barnes, at the 2015 International
Conference on Health Promoting Universities and Colleges
This Charter should be cited as:

A TRANSFORMATIVE VISION
FOR HEALTH PROMOTING
UNIVERSITIES & COLLEGES
Health promoting universities and colleges1 transform the health and
sustainability of our current and future societies, strengthen communities
and contribute to the well-being of people, places and the planet.
SHARED ASPIRATIONS
Health promoting universities and colleges infuse health into everyday
operations, business practices and academic mandates. By doing so, health
promoting universities and colleges enhance the success of our institutions;
create campus cultures of compassion, well-being, equity and social justice;
improve the health of the people who live, learn, work, play and love on our
campuses; and strengthen the ecological, social and economic sustainability
of our communities and wider society.

THE UNIQUE ROLE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
Higher education plays a central role in all aspects of the development of
individuals, communities, societies and cultures – locally and globally.
Higher education has a unique opportunity and responsibility to provide
transformative education, engage the student voice, develop new knowledge
and understanding, lead by example and advocate to decision-makers for
the benefit of society. In the emergent knowledge society, higher education
institutions are positioned to generate, share and implement knowledge and
research findings to enhance health of citizens and communities both now
and in the future.
A University or College is, by its very nature, an essential part of any systemic
health promotion strategy, working collaboratively in trans-disciplinary and
cross-sector ways. This Charter calls upon higher education institutions to
incorporate health promotion values and principles into their mission, vision
and strategic plans, and model and test approaches for the wider community
and society.

University of British Columbia Okanagan
The following opportunities exist on campuses:
• Advance the core mandate of higher education by improving human and
environmental health and well-being, which are determinants of learning,
productivity and engagement.
• Lead and influence by embedding health in knowledge production, student
development, institutional policies and campus cultures, thus benefiting
competencies of campus communities and setting an example for health
promoting settings more broadly.
• Align with global agendas such as World Health Organization's Cross
Sector Action and Health in All Policies and United Nations’ Post-2015
Development Agenda, thus improving equity, mental and physical well-
being, social justice, respect for diversity, sustainability and food security.
• Provide transformational teaching and learning environments that enable
and inspire students, faculty and staff9 to become healthy and engaged
citizens and leaders locally and globally.

9. Members of campus communities are described in various ways around the world (e.g., the term staff
may or may not include faculty and administrators). In this document, the term campus community
is inclusive of everyone on campus. However, occasionally students, faculty, staff, administrators and
others will be emphasized for clarity.

AN ACTION FRAMEWORK FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
The following framework provides two Calls to Action with key action
areas and overall principles that together guide the development of Health
Promoting Universities and Colleges.
Call to Action 1: Embed health into all aspects of campus culture, across
the administration, operations and academic mandates
1.1 Embed health in all campus policies. Review, create and coordinate
campus policies and practices with attention to health, well-being
and sustainability, so that all planning and decision-making takes
account of and supports the flourishing of people, campuses,
communities and our planet.
1.2 Create supportive campus environments. Enhance the campus
environment as a living laboratory, identifying opportunities to study
and support health and well-being, as well as sustainability and
resilience in the built, natural, social, economic, cultural, academic,
organizational and learning environments.
1.3 Generate thriving communities and a culture of well-being. Be
proactive and intentional in creating empowered, connected
and resilient campus communities that foster an ethic of care,
compassion, collaboration and community action.
1.4 Support personal development. Develop and create opportunities
to build student, staff and faculty resilience, competence, personal
capacity and life enhancing skills – and so support them to thrive
and achieve their full potential and become engaged local and global
citizens while respecting the environment.
1.5 Create or re-orient campus services. Coordinate and design
campus services to support equitable access, enhance health and
well-being, optimize human and ecosystem potential and promote
a supportive organizational culture.

Call to Action 2: Lead health promotion action and collaboration locally
and globally
2.1 Integrate health, well-being and sustainability in multiple
disciplines to develop change agents. Use cross-cutting
approaches to embed an understanding and commitment to health,
well-being and sustainability across all disciplines and curricula, thus
ensuring the development of future citizens with the capacity to act
as agents for health promoting change beyond campuses.
2.2 Advance research, teaching and training for health promotion
knowledge and action. Contribute to health promoting knowledge
production, application, standard setting and evaluation that
advance multi-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary research agendas
relevant to real world outcomes, and also, ensure training, learning,
teaching and knowledge exchange that will benefit the future well-
being of our communities, societies and planet.
2.3 Lead and partner towards local and global action for health
promotion. Build and support inspiring and effective relationships
and collaborations on and off campus to develop, harness and
mobilize knowledge and action for health promotion locally and
globally.

KEY PRINCIPLES FOR ACTION
The following are guiding principles for how to mobilize systemic and whole
campus action.10
• Use settings and whole system approaches
Use holistic settings and systems as the foci for inquiry and intervention,
effectively drawing attention to the opportunities to create conditions for
health in higher education. Set an example for health promotion action
in other settings.
• Ensure comprehensive and campus-wide approaches
Develop and implement multiple interconnected strategies that focus on
everyone in the campus community.
• Use participatory approaches and engage the voice of students and
others
Set ambitious goals and allow for solutions and strategies to emerge
through use of participatory approaches to engage broad, meaningful
involvement from all stakeholders, including students, staff, faculty,
administrators and other decision makers. Set priorities and build
multilevel commitments to action.
• Develop trans-disciplinary collaborations and cross-sector partnerships
Develop collaborations and partnerships across disciplines and sectors,
both within the campus community and with local and global partners,
to support the development of whole campus action for health and the
creation of knowledge and action for health promotion in communities
more broadly.
______________________________
10. Higher education settings and contexts differ greatly around the world. These principles can and
should be tailored accordingly.

• Promote research, innovation and evidence-informed action
Ensure that research and innovation contribute evidence to guide
the formulation of health enhancing policies and practices, thereby
strengthening health and sustainability in campus communities and
wider society. Based on evidence, revise action over time.
• Build on strengths
Use an asset-based and salutogenic approach to recognize strengths,
understand problems, celebrate successes and share lessons learned,
creating opportunities for the continual enhancement of health and well-
being on campus.
• Value local and indigenous communities' contexts and priorities The words local and
Advance health promotion through engagement and an informed indigenous are used with
understanding of local and indigenous communities' contexts and intention to recognize
priorities, and consideration of vulnerable and transitioning11 populations' social and cultural
diversity, inclusive of
perspectives and experiences.
history, traditions, values
and knowledge.
• Act on an existing universal responsibility
Act on the “right to health” enshrined in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights to ensure health promotion action embodies principles of
social justice, equity, dignity and respect for diversity while recognizing
the interconnectedness between people's health, social and economic
systems and global ecological change.
______________________________
11. Transitioning populations refers to the local and global movement of people, including immigrants
and refugees of war, political oppression, environmental changes and disasters.

Okanagan Charter Design Lab
ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE OKANAGAN CHARTER
This international Charter was an outcome of the 2015 International Conference on Health
Promoting Universities and Colleges12 held on the University of British Columbia's Okanagan
campus in Kelowna, Canada on June 22-25. The Charter development process engaged
researchers, practitioners, administrators, students and policy makers from 45 countries.13
The first draft of the Charter was based on input from 225 people through a pre-conference
survey and expert interviews as well as a review of existing Charters and Declarations.
At the Conference, with the support of a writing team, 380 delegates critiqued and refined
the Charter in a design lab and development sessions. Delegates were invited to bring
forward into the Charter development, ideas from the multiple plenaries and concurrent
sessions that comprised the scientific program.14 On the final Conference day, higher
education leaders and delegates, including network and organization representatives, signed
a Pledge to bring the Charter back to their settings to inspire and catalyze further action
towards the creation of health promoting universities and colleges. Representatives from
the World Health Organization, Pan American Health Organization and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization joined in the Pledge.
Through dissemination and use of the Charter in higher education, network building and
future conferences, our hope is that health promotion will be advanced internationally.
