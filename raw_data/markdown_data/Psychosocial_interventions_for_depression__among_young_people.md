Psychosocial interventions for depression
among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa:
a systematic review and meta-analysis
Lotenna Olisaeloka1*, Echezona Udokanma2 and Asma Ashraf3
Abstract
Background Depression among young people is a global health problem due to its rising prevalence and negative
physical and social outcomes. The prevalence of depression and the treatment gap among young people in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) is higher than global estimates. Most psychosocial interventions for adolescent and youth
depression were developed in high-income countries and less is known about their effectiveness in SSA. Due to con-
textual differences, findings from High-Income Countries (HICs) are less applicable to SSA. Yet, no systematic review
of psychosocial interventions for depression among young people in SSA has been conducted.
Methods A systematic literature search of four databases (Medline, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane library)
was conducted. Experimental studies published before May 2024 that evaluated the effect of psychosocial interven-
tions on depressive symptoms among young people (aged 10–24 years) in SSA were included in the systematic
review. Effect sizes (Hedge’s g (g)) indicating differences between intervention and control groups were calculated
using a random effects model.
Results Twenty-two eligible studies were identified for the systematic review, of which eighteen randomized control
trials (RCTs) involving 2338 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The findings revealed that psychosocial
interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (g = −1.55, 95% CI −2.48, −0.63), although heterogeneity
was high (I2 = 98.8%). Subgroup analysis revealed that efficacy differed significantly by intervention type, with Cogni-
tive Behavioural Therapy (9 studies) showing the strongest effect (g = −2.84, 95% CI −4.29; −1.38). While Wise Interven-
tions (a form of positive psychology interventions; 2 studies) had a moderate effect (g = −0.46, 95% C.I −0.53, −0.39),
Interpersonal Psychotherapy (2 studies; g = −0.08, 95% CI −1.05, 0.88) and Creative Psychological Interventions (3 stud-
ies; g = −0.29, 95% CI −1.38, 0.79) showed smaller, non-significant effects. Sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high
risk of bias strengthened the effect size. Few studies assessed factors affecting intervention efficacy and showed
mixed effects of age, gender, and adherence levels.
Conclusion Psychosocial interventions, particularly CBT, significantly reduced depressive symptoms among young
people in SSA. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the high heterogeneity which likely stems from variations
in study populations and intervention delivery modalities. This highlights the need for further research to identify
the specific intervention components and delivery methods that work best for distinct subpopulations. Future
research should also explore how long intervention effects are maintained and factors affecting efficacy.
