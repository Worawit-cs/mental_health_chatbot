Keywords: Introduction: Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among health sciences students represent a growing concern
Suicidal ideation that requires a systematic evaluation of their global prevalence.
Suicide attempt Objective: To determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among health sciences students

considered eligible. Studies could employ either probabilistic or non-probabilistic sampling, with no restrictions
on language. Stratified meta-analyses were performed according to assessment instrument and time frame, and
meta-regression was conducted by year of study.
Results: Of 1277 identified records, 38 studies met the eligibility criteria. Suicidal ideation assessment was
conducted using two instruments: the Beck Scale, which assesses lifetime suicidal thoughts, showing a prevalence
of 14.09 % (95 % CI: 11.39–17.02 %), and item 9 of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), which evaluates
death thoughts in the past two weeks, with a prevalence of 19.18 % (95 % CI: 12.65–26.69 %). Suicide attempts,
evaluated by time frame, showed a prevalence of 7.06 % (95 % CI: 4.35–10.35 %) for "lifetime" and 4.45 % (95 %
CI: 2.62–6.71 %) for the "past 12 months. " Temporal meta-regression showed no significant trends.
Conclusions: The prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among health sciences students is sub-
stantial, varying by assessment instrument and time frame. These findings, though affected by considerable
heterogeneity across studies and limited representativeness of samples, underscore the need to implement sys-
tematic screening and prevention programs in health sciences educational institutions.
