they were more likely to be women (66% vs 58%; χ2
p<0.01), slightly younger (mean 18.2 vs 18.5 years, p<0.01)
and domestic Canadian students (90.1% vs 87.3%, χ2
p<0.01). These differences were small. When compared
with the time 1 sample, the time 2 sample was compa-
rable in terms of age, lifetime history of mental illness
and early life adversity. However, there were significantly
more women (67% vs 74%; χ2 p<0.01), fewer indigenous
(0.3 vs 0%) and more mixed ethnicities (9.5 vs 12%; χ2
for ethnicity overall p=0.03), fewer parents with profes-
sional or doctorate degrees (22% vs 12%; χ2 p<0.01) and
a higher rate of family mental illness (40% vs 44%; χ2
p=0.02). Again, aside from the proportion of women, and
parental education, these differences are generally small.
This suggests that results are reasonably representative of
the target population.
Changes in students’ internalising scores are illustrated
in the online supplemental materials. Stability is more
common than change, and non-c linical levels of symp-
toms are more common than clinical levels of symptoms.
At time 1, the rate of clinically significant anxiety symp-
toms in students was 32.1%, whereas for depressive symp-
toms, this was 26.7%. At time 2, this increased to 37.0%
