and cardiovascular disorders. Focus on reducing risk
through education and monitoring.

II. Conduct a MNS Assessment
Conducting an assessment for MNS conditions involves the following steps. First, the presenting complaint is explored, then a history is obtained including
asking about past MNS issues, general health problems, family MNS history, and psychosocial history. Observe the person (Mental Status Exam), establish
a differential diagnosis, and identify the MNS condition. As part of the assessment, conduct a physical examination and obtain basic laboratory tests as
needed. The assessment is conducted with informed consent of the person.

CLINICAL TIP:
Once a MNS disorder is suspected,
always assess for self harm/suicide ( SUI )
* Mental Status Examination adapted for non-specialists may include: Behavior and Appearance = symptoms and signs involving the way a person looks or acts; Mood and Affect = symptoms and signs involving
the regulation and expression of emotions or feeling states; Content of Thought = symptoms and signs involving subject matter of thoughts including delusions, paranoia, suspiciousness and suicidal ideation;
Perceptual Disturbance = sensory perceptions occurring in the absence of the appropriate (external) stimulus (e.g. auditory or visual hallucinations). The person may or may not have insight into the unreal nature of the
perception; Cognition = symptoms, signs and clinical findings indicative of a disturbance in mental abilities and processes related to attention, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem solving, decision making,
comprehension and the integration of these functions.

III. Manage MNS Conditions
Once the assessment is conducted, follow the management algorithm in mhGAP-IG to manage the MNS disorder.
Key steps in management are found in the box below.
MANAGEMENT STEPS FOR MNS CONDITIONS

Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable disorder of the brain, Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and

Is the substance use harmful?
For each substance used assess:
A Frequency and quantity of use. (Hint: Ask “How many days per week do you use this substance? How much do you use per day?”)
B Harmful behaviours. (Hint: Ask “Does your substance use cause you any problems?”)
– Injuries and accidents – Sexual activity while intoxicated that was risky – Violence towards others
– Driving while intoxicated or later regretted – Poor performance in education, employment roles
– Drug injection, sharing needles, reusing needles – Legal or financial problems – Poor performance in expected social roles
– Relationship problems as a result of use – Inability to care for children responsibly (e.g. parenting)

Is DEPENDENCE likely?

Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders are highly prevalent,
accounting for a substantial burden of disease and disability globally. In order to
bridge the gap between available resources and the significant need for services, the
World Health Organization launched the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).
The objective of mhGAP is to scale-up care and services using evidence-based interventions
for prevention and management of priority MNS conditions. The mhGAP Intervention Guide
version 1.0 for MNS disorders for non-specialist health settings was developed in 2010 as
a simple technical tool to allow for integrated management of priority MNS conditions using
protocols for clinical decision-making.
With uptake in over 90 countries, mhGAP-IG 1.0 version has had widespread success. It is our pleasure to
present mhGAP version 2.0, with updates incorporating new evidence-based guidance, enhanced usability,
and new sections to expand its use by both health care providers as well as programme managers.
It is our hope that this guide will continue to provide the road-map to deliver care and services for people with
MNS disorders around the world and lead us closer to achieving the goal of universal health coverage.
The mhGAP-IG version 2.0 includes the following sections:
