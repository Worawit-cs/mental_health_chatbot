Foreword
This Guidance on mental health policy and strategic action plans provides countries with a comprehensive
pathway to mental health policy reform. This is in line with an increasing consensus on the importance of
embracing rights-based, person-centered, and recovery-oriented approaches that emphasize autonomy and
dignity, while also engaging people with lived experience in planning and decision-making.
Our collective vision is for a world where mental health is integrated into primary health care, and where services
are accessible, respectful, and empowering. Mental health planning should also take into account the social and
structural factors such as poverty, housing, education, and employment, as well as the negative impact of stigma,
discrimination, and other systemic barriers. Addressing these interconnected issues is fundamental to achieving
holistic and sustainable outcomes. Collaboration across sectors is essential to implement equitable and effective
community-based services.
This publication is a testament to the invaluable contributions of people with lived experience, whose voices
and insights are central to this transformative agenda. It is their stories, resilience, and advocacy that underpin
the urgency of this work and inspire us towards a more inclusive and compassionate world. This Guidance is a
vital resource for policymakers, practitioners, and advocates alike, providing practical and actionable strategies
to accelerate progress, while helping to protect the rights and dignity of those seeking care.

x Guidance on mental health policy and strategic action plans: Module 5

Glossary
Biomedical model
The biomedical model views mental health conditions as primarily caused by neurobiological factors (1, 2). With
this approach the main focus of care is on diagnosis, medication, and symptom reduction, often overlooking
the social and structural factors affecting mental health and individuals’ needs and rights for inclusion, social
protection, among others (3).
Community mental health care
Community-based mental health care, including both specialized and non-specialized care, allows people to live
and to receive care within their own communities, rather than in institutional settings (such as psychiatric
hospitals or social care facilities), promoting equality and inclusion within society. Community mental health
care involves a network of interconnected services, including: mental health services integrated into general
health care; community mental health centres; outreach, providing care at home or in public spaces; and access
to key social and other support services. While there is no universal model for organizing these services, every
country can take steps to restructure and expand community mental health care to uphold the right to live and
be included in the community (3).
Deinstitutionalization
Deinstitutionalization involves relocating individuals from institutional settings back into their communities and
closing institutional beds to prevent further admissions. Successful deinstitutionalization requires comprehensive
community-based services, sufficient financial and structural investment, and a shift in mindsets and practices
to value people’s rights to community inclusion, liberty, and autonomy (3).
Disability
According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (C R P D), disability results
from the interaction between individuals with impairments or health conditions and societal barriers that limit
their full and equal participation. Article 1 of the C R P D defines “persons with disabilities” as those with long-term
physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that, when combined with barriers, hinder their full and
effective participation in society. This reflects the social model of disability, which highlights the role of societal
barriers that give rise to disability, and the human rights model, which asserts that people with disabilities have
the right to demand the removal of these barriers to ensure equality and non-discrimination (4).
Groups that face discrimination
This refers to groups of people within a given culture, context and history, who face, or are at risk of, discrimination
and exclusion due to unequal power relationships. These groups may face discrimination based on age, gender,
sexual orientation, disability, migrant and refugee status, race and ethnicity, indigeneity, houselessness status,
language, religion, political or other opinions, education or income, living in various localities, or any other status
(5). Discrimination on any such ground is prohibited in international human rights law.
Human rights-based approach
This is an approach grounded in international human rights law, aimed at promoting and protecting human rights.
In mental health, it involves adopting legal and policy frameworks that comply with State obligations under international
law. It equips both State and non-State actors to identify, analyze, and address inequalities and discrimination, and
to reach those who are marginalized. It also provides avenues for redress and accountability when necessary (6).
xi

Legal capacity
The C R P D defines legal capacity as “…the capacity to be both a holder of rights and an actor under the law. Legal
capacity to be a holder of rights entitles persons to full protection of their rights by the legal system. Legal capacity
to act under the law recognizes the person as an agent with the power to engage in transactions, and create, modify
or end legal relationships” (7). Legal capacity is an inherent and inalienable right, distinct from ‘mental capacity’
(which refers to people’s decision-making abilities) since, regardless of a person’s perceived abilities to make decisions,
under the C R P D they nevertheless retain their right to exercise their legal capacity on an equal basis with others.
L G B T I Q +
L G B T I Q + is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer/questioning people. The plus
sign represents people of diverse sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics
who identify with other terms. This acronym, adopted from a Western (predominantly Anglophone) context, has
become a term of convenience in the realm of public health and health research, including for some normative
statements on human rights by W H O and other U N entities (8). While the acronym L G B T I Q + (or a derivation of
it, such as L G B or L G B T) is widely used globally and in U N publications, it does not encompass the full diversity
of terms used to describe sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics.
Lived experience
This can refer to personal experience with mental health services, mental health conditions, or specific living
conditions like poverty. It describes how someone has experienced and understands a particular situation,
challenge, or health issue.
Mental health and psychosocial support (M H P S S)
This is a composite term for any local or external support aimed at protecting or promoting psychosocial
well-being or preventing and treating mental health conditions (9).
Procedural accommodation
This refers to necessary modifications and adjustments in the context of access to justice, ensuring equal
participation for persons with disabilities and other groups. Unlike reasonable accommodations, procedural
accommodations are not limited by the concept of disproportionate or undue burden (10).
Person-centred care
This focuses on aligning care with individuals’ preferences, needs, values, and strengths, and with people’s
unique circumstances and goals in life. It requires that people actively participate in decisions about their
treatment and care, aiming to foster trusting partnerships, dignity, respect, and autonomy, while also addressing
social and structural factors affecting mental health in order to provide holistic care (11).
Psychiatric and social care institutions
Institutions are living environments where residents are separated from the broader community, are often
isolated, and lack control over their lives and decisions affecting them. Such settings also often prioritize
institutional over individuals’ needs (12). Institutions may include standalone psychiatric hospitals, social care
homes, and other facilities where people experience these restrictions. Even small, community-based facilities
can be considered institutional if they impose rigid routines, restrict autonomy, and fail to promote genuine
community inclusion. This definition does not include psychiatric units or services located in the community
and integrated within general hospitals, and within the broader general healthcare system, provided that
autonomy and rights are respected.
xii Guidance on mental health policy and strategic action plans: Module 5

Psychosocial disability
This guidance adopts the definition of disability set out in the C R P D — see above. In this context, psychosocial
disability refers to the barriers (for example discrimination, stigma and exclusion) that arise from the interaction
between individuals with mental health difficulties and attitudinal and environmental factors that hinder people’s
full and equal participation in society. This term emphasizes a social rather than a medical approach to mental
and emotional experiences. While the C R P D uses the term “impairment”, this Guidance avoids this term in order
to respect the diverse perspectives of people with lived experience of psychosocial disability, and the dynamic
nature of mental and emotional states (3, 13, 14).
Reasonable accommodation
The C R P D defines reasonable accommodation as necessary and appropriate modifications that do not impose
a disproportionate or undue burden, ensuring that persons with disabilities and other groups can enjoy and
exercise all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others (15).
Recovery
The recovery approach in mental health focuses on supporting people to regain or maintain control over their
lives. Recovery is personal and different for each person, and can include finding meaning and purpose, living
a self-directed life, strengthening self-worth, healing from trauma, and having hope for the future. Each person
defines what recovery means for them and decides which areas of life to focus on as part of their recovery
journey. Recovery views the person and their context as a whole, rather than aiming for the absence of symptoms
or a so-called cure (16).
Substitute decision-making
This refers to regimes where a person’s legal capacity is removed, and a substitute decision-maker is appointed
to make decisions on their behalf, often based on what is perceived as the person’s best interests, rather than
their own will and preferences (17).
Supported decision-making
The C R P D describes supported decision-making as regimes that provide various support options enabling a
person to exercise legal capacity and make decisions with support (18). Supported decision-making can take
many forms but does not remove or restrict legal capacity. A supporter cannot be appointed by a third party
without the person’s consent, and support must align with the individual’s will and preferences (19).
Glossary xiii

Executive summary
Mental health policy reform is urgent
Mental health has become a global priority, recognized as influencing every aspect of life — from emotional
and social well-being to physical health, relationships, and community involvement. It is a vital asset that should
be protected and nurtured for individuals and societies to thrive. To achieve this, governments need to establish
robust policies and approaches to address the mental health needs of their populations, while continually acting
to protect and promote mental well-being.
In response there is growing momentum for policies to adopt a rights-based, person-centred, and recovery-
oriented approach, in line with international human rights commitments, such as the Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities and the W H O Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 (20, 21). These
approaches emphasize addressing stigma and discrimination and ensuring people’s autonomy, dignity, and
rights are respected. They also stress that mental health should be integrated as a core component of Universal
Health Coverage (U H C) and the universal need for equitable access to comprehensive, quality mental health
services, regardless of people’s socioeconomic status or geographical location.
Despite these global commitments, many countries still lack mental health policies and plans that fully align
with international human rights standards or address the broader societal factors affecting mental health. All
countries having endorsed W H O’s Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 are committed to developing,
updating, and implementing national policies and strategies, with a global target for 80% of countries to achieve
this alignment by 2030.
A comprehensive framework for reform
This Guidance on mental health policy and strategic action plans was created to support countries in reforming
their mental health policies and updating strategic action plans, placing human rights and the social and structural
determinants of mental health at the core of all policy reform efforts. Grounded in international human rights
frameworks, particularly the U N Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (C R P D), the Guidance calls
for mental health systems that promote legal capacity, non-coercive practices, participation, and community
inclusion. It aims to ensure that all people are treated with dignity, respect, and on an equal basis with others.
By addressing broader social and structural determinants – such as poverty, housing insecurity, unemployment,
and discrimination – and emphasizing multi-sectoral collaboration, the guidance promotes a holistic approach
to mental health reform, advancing equity and social justice.
This Guidance serves as a valuable resource not only for policy-makers and planners but also for a wide range
of stakeholders, including individuals and organizations involved in mental health advocacy and reform. It can
help these stakeholders gain a better understanding of mental health systems, policy reform processes and
key issues to be addressed in the development and implementation of rights-based mental health policy and
strategic actions.

Structure of the Guidance
The Guidance discusses important policy areas for reform and outlines key steps that countries should work
through in developing, implementing, evaluating and monitoring their mental health policy and strategic
action plan. The Guidance is divided into five modules published as separate documents.
Module 1. Introduction, purpose and use of the guidance
This module discusses the challenges related to mental health policy and the need for reform in line with the
international human rights framework, highlighting essential considerations and new directions.
Module 2. Key reform areas, directives, strategies, and actions for mental health
policy and strategic action plans
This module details five key policy areas for reform together with associated directives, strategies and actions
that can be prioritized and adapted by policy-makers and planners according to each country’s specific contexts.
Key policy areas for reform
Within each policy area, a menu of policy directives, strategies, and actions guides reform efforts, helping policy-
makers and planners prioritize and tailor policies to their specific context, in line with their available resources
or organizational structures. At the end of each policy area, the Guidance highlights key issues requiring special
considerations for diverse groups: children and adolescents, older adults, women, men and gender-diverse
persons, the L G B T I Q + community, persons with disabilities, migrants and refugees, persons from minoritized
racial and ethnic groups, Indigenous Peoples, and persons who are houseless or with unstable housing. Due
to unique characteristics, life circumstances, or unmet needs, these groups may require specific support and
attention beyond that of the general population.

xvi Guidance on mental health policy and strategic action plans: Module 5

Module 3. Process for developing, implementing, and evaluating mental health
policy and strategic action plans
This module outlines key principles and nine discrete and non-linear steps.
1. Conduct high-level policy dialogue. Bring together high-level stakeholders from key sectors and civil
society to establish commitment and engagement for mental health reform.
2. Establish a multistakeholder advisory committee. This committee is important to oversee development
and implementation of the policy and strategic action plan with input from all relevant sectors and stakeholders,
including people with lived experience.
3. Build understanding and new mindsets. It is key to address stigma and discrimination and resistance to
rights-based approaches from the outset of policy development.
4. Review international human rights obligations and commitments. Understanding key international
human rights frameworks, including the U N Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (C R P D) is
essential to inform policy development.
5. Undertake situational analysis. Assess the current mental health context, identifying gaps, priorities, and
challenges to inform policy and strategic action plan development.
6. Draft the mental health policy. Develop the mental health policy, including key areas for action and policy
directives based on a situational analysis, incorporating input from all relevant stakeholders.
7. Draft the mental health strategic action plan. Develop a strategic action plan with defined strategies
including timeframes, targets, indicators, specific actions, outputs, and costs to effectively implement the policy.
8. Implement the policy and strategic action plan. Well-planned and sustainable implementation requires
awareness-raising, dissemination, and communication; incremental and scaled up implementation processes;
fundraising; and a realistic programme of work.
9. Monitor and evaluate. Set up mechanisms to continuously track progress, identify challenges, and adjust
for successful implementation.
Checklists are also included to help planners assess and evaluate both pre-existing and newly drafted policies
and strategic action plans.
Executive summary xvii

Module 4. Country case scenarios
This module provides three country case scenarios to illustrate the varied approaches countries can take when
reforming their mental health policy, including how policy directives, strategies, and actions can be tailored to
fit specific local contexts.
Module 5. Comprehensive directory of policy areas, directives, strategies and
actions for mental health (this document)
This module provides a quick access directory to material discussed in Module 2, enabling easy navigation.
A pathway to action
This Guidance offers a comprehensive blueprint and framework for developing national mental health policies
and strategic action plans and aligning them with international human rights standards. It outlines key policy
areas for reform, including policy directives, associated strategies and actions that are adaptable and can be
selected and prioritized in line with country-specific contexts. It also advocates a rights-based, person-centred,
and recovery-oriented approach while addressing the social and structural determinants of mental health. By
promoting multi-sectoral collaboration, the guidance provides a pathway to building equitable, inclusive mental
health systems that respect autonomy and dignity.
Countries are urged to implement this guidance to reform their mental health policies, so that these deliver
lasting, evidence-based and rights-driven solutions for all.
xviii Guidance on mental health policy and strategic action plans: Module 5

Introduction
Module 5 of this Guidance provides a comprehensive directory of key policy areas, directives, strategies, and
actions. It serves as a quick and easy, at-a-glance reference for stakeholders involved in mental health policy
reform and implementation. This directory helps stakeholders efficiently navigate through policy areas, directives,
and their corresponding strategies and actions, making it a practical tool for facilitating discussions on policy
reform and planning with staff and key stakeholder groups.
The first diagram presents an overview of the five Policy areas and their associated policy directives, as discussed
in Module 2 of the Guidance.
The subsequent diagrams delve deeper, linking each policy directive to its specific strategies, which are further
broken down into actions. This structure provides a clear overarching view of how policy directives and strategies
can be implemented effectively within each policy area.
Using this directory as a starting point, policy-makers can quickly identify which key elements are relevant,
already in place, missing, or require improvement within their mental health systems, policies, and strategic
action plans.
See Module 2. Key policy areas, directives, strategies, and actions for mental health policy and strategic action plans
for more detailed discussion of policy areas and their key challenges, and for more in-depth information on each
policy directive, and associated strategies and actions.
Module 4 offers three country case scenarios, illustrating how situations might influence the choice of policy
directives strategies and actions, and how these might also be modified to fit the context.
Refer to Module 1. Introduction, purpose and use of the guidance for an introductory discussion of the challenges
related to mental health policy and the need for reform in line with the international human rights framework.
Module 3. Process for developing, implementing, and evaluating mental health policy and strategic action plans
outlines key principles for reforming mental health policy and nine discrete non-linear steps for achieving this.
