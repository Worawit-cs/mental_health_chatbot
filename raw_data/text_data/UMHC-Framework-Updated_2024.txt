Organisations
In creating the UMHC, we consulted with a
significant number of organisations who already
provided award schemes and charter marks on
other issues for the sector. We appreciate the
time, honesty and good advice they provided.
Funders
The development of the UMHC Framework
has been funded by the UPP Foundation and
the Office for Students (OfS) and we are very
grateful for their ongoing support. The update
to the UMHC Framework has been completed
with funding from the Department for Education
(DfE) and OfS. This funding is also supporting the
development of the UMHC Award process and
additional resources for the sector.

The second edition
In the five years since the UMHC Framework
was published a lot more research has been
published on the many aspects of university
student and staff mental health. In addition,
new guidance has appeared and some old
guidance has been significantly updated or
revised. We had initially hoped to update the
UMHC Framework more regularly, but this
was another of our plans that had to flex to
new circumstances. We are grateful to the
Department for Education and the Office
for Students for providing funding that has
allowed us to undertake a bigger review of
the white and grey literature to date, so we
could complete this updated edition.

The future
At the time of writing, the higher education
sector continues to face considerable challenges
and there are still good reasons to be concerned
about the mental health of staff and students.
Nevertheless, universities remain extraordinary

institutions dedicated to the development of

research and spreading ideas out into the world.

universities are unions of people – as they
were when first founded in Bologna and Paris.
Wisdom is not generated by process and
organisation but by people, coming together to
learn and explore. For this to be possible, these
people need to find themselves in environments
that are conducive to learning, creativity,
community and insight. In other words, in
environments that are supportive of their
wellbeing. We hope the UMHC Framework can
help to play a role in shaping the development of
our universities, making them happier, healthier
places to be and successfully generating the
greater wisdom we so clearly need.

and greater innovation. As colleagues begin
to better understand the roles and work of
others, they also increasingly recognise shared
challenges and experiences and the possibility
of new solutions that can emerge from pooled
expertise and resources. This contributes to the
development of shared language, narratives,
mission and purpose and through this to an
increased sense of community. As this phase
develops, this is shared not only across the
university but also through hierarchies, from
executive teams down to all staff and into the
student community. This firm foundation leads to
more innovative practice and learning that may
be beneficial to the sector as a whole.
Cross-university collaboration means that these
institutions are more able to demonstrate a
consistent approach to meeting the Principles of
Good Practice and a shared understanding that
indicates a cohesive whole-university approach.
This can be seen in the ways in which the culture
of the university is experienced and expressed
by students and staff. Importantly, within this
generation of change, universities also begin to
openly acknowledge and tackle more complex
problems and to move away from seeking quick
and simple solutions towards a genuine wish
to find deeper, more effective and sustainable
answers. This may, for example, be the need to
properly and honestly address working hours or
to identify and eradicate toxic research cultures.
At the more mature end of this generation of
change, universities are beginning to identify
a further stage of development in which
approaches to mental health and wellbeing
become part of the core structure of university
business and culture.

has been published since 2019. The review
covered both white and grey literature, as well
as updated guidance and frameworks, and took
a grounded approach, beginning with general
search terms and gradually expanding. General
terms were searched first, such as ‘student
mental health’, ‘student wellbeing’, ‘wellbeing of
academic staff’ etc. Additional searches were
then undertaken in each theme using the theme
headings and the Principles of Good Practice.
The findings of the review were then used to
update each section and theme, checking to
ensure text was in line with current evidence and
altering text where necessary. The update was
then submitted to a team of peer reviewers, with
themes being distributed to reviewers according
