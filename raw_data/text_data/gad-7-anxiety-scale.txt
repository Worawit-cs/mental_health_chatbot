Scoring
Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively.
When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.
Using the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for GAD. It is
moderately good at screening three other common anxiety disorders - panic disorder (sensitivity 74%,
specificity 81%), social anxiety disorder (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%) and post-traumatic stress
disorder (sensitivity 66%, specificity 81%).
