Keywords: Background: The global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought huge changes to people’s lifestyles, college students
The COVID-19 pandemic have also been affected seriously. Evidence about these significant changes indicated that college students were
College student more prone to feel anxious and depressed. To derive a precise assessment of the prevalence of anxiety symptom
Anxiety symptom
and depressive symptom among college students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis.

Methods: Based on the guidance of PRISMA, literature was searched in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and
Meta-analysis
PsycArticles (last search November 6, 2020). These articles after the screening were analyzed by a random-effects
model to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom. Also, subgroup analysis,
sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were performed in this meta-analysis.
Results: The results showed that the pooled anxiety symptom prevalence was 31% (95% CI: 23-39%), pooled
depressive symptom prevalence was 34% (95% CI: 27-41%). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of
anxiety symptom and depressive symptom among different countries’ college students were different, and the
pooled depressive symptom prevalence of females was higher compared with males.
Limitations: The prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom in worldwide college students could be
better assessed by a standard and reliable questionnaire.
Conclusions: The results suggest that the prevalence of anxiety symptom and depressive symptom during the
COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Except for interventions that should be taken to control the pandemic
urgently, mental health services are also needed to decrease the risk of anxiety and depression among college
students.
