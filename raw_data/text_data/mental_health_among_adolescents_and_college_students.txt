Meta-analysis including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase, up until November 1st, 2022. It is essential to
emphasize that our focus was the evaluation of symptoms (continuous outcomes), rather than the diagnosis of
specific mental disorders. The meta-analysis was performed using the R version 4.3.1. The effect size measure
was the standardized mean difference (SMD), and random-effects models were used to pool data from eligible
RCTs. Subgroup analyses were carried out to examine variations in intervention effects based on factors such as
sample type, intervention modality, guidance type, and intervention duration.
Results: The meta-analysis was based on 25 comparisons involving a total of 4480 participants. In comparison to
the control group (n =2125), participants receiving interventions (n =2355) reported significant reductions in
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, along with a significant improvement in quality of life. Specifically,
for depression, we observed moderate intervention effects (SMD =(cid:0) 0.42, 95 % CI: (cid:0) 0.56, (cid:0) 0.27), and a similar
pattern was seen for quality of life (SMD =0.36, 95%CI: 0.22, 0.49). Small intervention effects were found for
anxiety (SMD =(cid:0) 0.35, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 0.48, (cid:0) 0.22]) and stress (SMD =(cid:0) 0.35, 95 % CI [(cid:0) 0.51, (cid:0) 0.20]). Given
significant heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted for anxiety and depression, considering factors such
as sample type, intervention method, and intervention duration. Notably, college students experienced more
significant benefits in both anxiety and depression alleviation compared to adolescents. Longer interventions
(>8 weeks) were particularly effective in reducing anxiety and depression. Additionally, third-wave cognitive-
behavioral therapy (CBT) showed pronounced intervention effects in both outcome measures, while the presence
of guidance did not notably influence results.
Conclusion: This meta-analysis underscores the positive impact of Internet-based self-help programs in alleviating
the symptoms of psychological disorders among adolescents and college students. However, it is crucial to
acknowledge that the available evidence exhibits inconsistencies and limitations. Therefore, further research
utilizing rigorous methodologies is necessary to verify and broaden the findings of this meta-analysis.
