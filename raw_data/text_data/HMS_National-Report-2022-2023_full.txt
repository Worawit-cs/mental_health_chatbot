STUDY PURPOSE
The Healthy Minds Study provides a detailed picture of mental health and related issues in college student populations.
Schools typically use their data for some combination of the following purposes: to identify needs and priorities;
benchmark against peer institutions; evaluate programs and policies; plan for services and programs; and advocate for
resources.
STUDY DESIGN
The Healthy Minds Study is designed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants. HMS is approved by
Advarra. To further protect respondent privacy, the study is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National
Institutes of Health.
SAMPLING
Each participating school provides the HMS team with a sample of currently enrolled students over the age of 18, either
randomly selected or their entire student population. Schools with graduate students typically include both undergraduates
and graduate students in the sample.
DATA COLLECTION
HMS is a web-based survey. Students are invited and reminded to participate in the survey via emails, which are timed to
avoid, if at all possible, the first two weeks of the term, the last week of the term, and any major holidays. The data
collection protocol begins with an email invitation, and non-responders are contacted up to three times by email reminders.
Reminders are only sent to those who have not yet completed the survey. Each communication contains a URL that
students use to gain access to the survey.
NON-RESPONSE ANALYSIS
A potential concern in any survey study is that those who respond to the survey will not be fully representative of the
population from which they are drawn. In the HMS, we can be confident that those who are invited to fill out the survey
are representative of the full student population because these students are randomly selected from the full list of
currently enrolled students. However it is still possible that those who actually complete the survey are different in
important ways from those who do not complete the survey. It is important to raise the question of whether the
percentage of students who participated are different in important ways from those who did not participate. We address
this issue by constructing non-response weights. The non-response weights adjust specifically for the fact that female
students have consistently higher response rates than male students in our survey (and in most other survey studies). We
construct the weights by comparing the female-male composition of our respondent sample to the reported female-male
ratio for the full student population at each institution (which is typically available from basic enrollment statistics). If the
respondent sample has a smaller percentage of males and larger percentage of females, as compared to the composition
of the full student population, then male students in our sample are assigned a higher non-response weight value than
female students. This means that weighted estimates are representative of the female-male distribution in the full student
population. For students with nonbinary gender identities, we are not able to use this same process, however, because we
are generally not able to obtain accurate statistics on the representation of these groups in the full student population.
Therefore, rather than making assumptions, we assign a weight value to students with nonbinary identifiers that leaves
their representation in the weighted sample the same as in the unweighted sample. In the future, if and when more
reliable information becomes available at the full student population level, we will be able to incorporate that information
into sample weights for groups other than female and male gender identities. Finally, note that these sample weights give
equal aggregate weight to each school in the national estimates. An alternative would have been to assign weights in
proportion to school size, but we decided that we did not want our overall national estimates to be dominated by schools
in our sample with very large enrollments.

ABOUT THIS REPORT
This data report provides descriptive statistics (percentages, mean values, etc.) from the national sample of respondents
for a set of key measures. In addition to the key measures highlighted in this report, an appendix is also included with
descriptive statistics for each survey item (see below).
APPENDIX
The appendix includes values for most measures in the three standard survey modules that are administered on all
participating campuses: Demographics, Mental Health Status, and Mental Health Services Utilization/Help-Seeking. For
each measure, the data tables display the following information: the value for the national sample and the 95% confidence
interval for this value. All values in the appendix have been weighted to be representative of the full student populations to
which they refer (see Non-response Analysis). Also note that for some measures, respondents were allowed to check
more than one response category (e.g., they might have gone to more than one type of provider for mental health
services), so the percentages sometimes add up to more than 100% across response categories. The 95% confidence
intervals give a sense of how much uncertainty there is about each estimated value. This uncertainty exists because our
estimates are based only on a random sample of students, rather than a complete census of the student population.
However, some schools that had less than 4,000 students (the typical requested sample size), provided their entire
population. For consistency sake, these schools were not treated any differently than those schools that provided a 4,000
student sample of their full population. Essentially, the confidence interval tells us that there is a 95% probability that the
true population value is within this particular range.

Personal stigma: agrees with "I would think less of someone who has received mental health 6%
treatment."
