which 30 boys and 30 girls of first year selected from the Bhavnagar City the research tool
used for the study was back inventory developed by Aron back. ‘t’ test was used for
statistical analysis of data. result shows that there is no significant difference between boys
and girls from college students in terms of depression. Here my hypothesis is accepted.

E
very person on this earth behaves to fulfill his own needs. The satisfaction of needs
gives him pleasure. But sometimes one cannot get the satisfaction of the needs due to
the social barrier or economic situation becoming an obstacle in satisfying one's needs.
So, one feels unsatisfied. Not everyone can fulfill all their needs. Such unfulfilled needs or
unsatisfied feelings create depression or melancholy in a person. In life, everyone is
sometimes a victim of depression. Some people can easily cope with depression Some people
can deal with depression easily. So, some can't bear even normal depression. In modern
times, the stress tolerance of a person is generally reduced. Everyone gets depressed quickly.
The co-occurrence of depression and anxiety is a commonly observed phenomenon,
suggesting a close interconnection between these mood disorders. Symptomatically, these
conditions tend to intertwine and become inseparable. Individuals experiencing depression
often exhibit symptoms that resemble those associated with anxiety disorders, including
feelings of nervousness, irritability, sleep disturbances, and difficulties in concentration.
Additionally, both depression and anxiety significantly increase the risk of suicidal ideation
and behaviors (Gilbert, 1992). It is worth noting that a substantial number of individuals who
develop depression have a history of prior anxiety disorders, indicating a potential sequential
relationship between these conditions in the life course of individuals. These insights
highlight the intricate relationship between depression and anxiety, emphasizing the
importance of comprehensive assessment and targeted treatment approaches that address the
overlapping symptoms and underlying mechanisms of both disorders.

A Study of Depression in College Students
Objectives
This research aims to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with depression
among students enrolled in arts colleges. By focusing on this specific population, the study
seeks to deepen our understanding of the mental health challenges faced by arts college
students and shed light on potential contributing factors to their depressive symptoms.
Through comprehensive data collection and analysis, the study intends to provide valuable
insights that can inform the development of targeted interventions and support systems to
promote the well-being and mental health of arts college students.
Hypothesis
1. There is no significant difference in the depression of boys and girls.
Controlled Variable:
This study will exclusively focus on students enrolled in colleges located in Bhavnagar city.
Specifically, the participants will be selected from arts stream colleges within Bhavnagar city.
By narrowing the scope to this specific geographical area and academic discipline, the
research aims to obtain a focused and contextually relevant understanding of the variables
under investigation. This targeted approach will enhance the study's applicability and enable
more accurate interpretations of the findings within the specific context of Bhavnagar city
and the arts stream education.
Sample:
For the current research, a sample of 60 college students from Bhavnagar city was selected
using a simple random sampling method. The sample consisted of 30 female students and 30
male students, who were chosen from within the college student population. This approach
ensures a balanced representation of both genders within the study, allowing for a
comprehensive analysis of the research objectives. By employing random sampling, the study
aims to enhance the generalizability of the findings to the larger population of college
students in Bhavnagar city.
Research Tools:
The following tools have been used in the present research to collect the necessary data.
1. PERSONAL INFORMATION TOOLS: Keeping in view the main objective of the
present research, a personal information sheet will be filled by the college students in which
things like Name, Age, Graduation, Gender etc. will be included.
2. BACK DEPRESSION INVENTORY: To measure depression, participants
completed Back Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck et al. It is the most commonly used
psychometric test intended to assess the presence and severity of depression. The inventory
comprises series of questions (21) developed to measure the intensity, severity and
depression.
Scoring:
Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. The scores on different items (expect items
20 and 21) corresponding to symptoms of depression is summed to give a single total score
for the total items. Items 20 and 21 are not part of the total scale score. They are provided to
help gather additional clinical information for the therapist. The manual contains general cut
that cut-- off guidelines, although the authors recommend off scores should be based upon
clinical decisions [total score 0 to 13 is considered minimal range, 14 to 19 is mild, 20 to 28
is moderate and 29 to 63 is severe (scores range from 0 to 63)

A Study of Depression in College Students
RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Table no:- 1.1
(N=60)
Gender N Mean SD df t Significant
Boy 30 22.7 4151.1
58 0.77
Girl 30 17.56 3515.3 NS
0.01 = 2.639
0.05 = 1.990
INTERPRETATION:
Upon reviewing the results table, it is evident that the mean score for boys is 22.7, with a
standard deviation of 4151.1. Conversely, the mean score for girls is 17.56, accompanied by a
standard deviation of 3515.3. The calculated 't' value is 0.77. With a degrees of freedom of 58
and a significance level of 0.05, referring to the critical values in the 't' table, it is observed
that the tabulated 't' value is 1.990.
Comparing the calculated 't' value of 0.77 to the tabulated 't' value of 1.990, it is evident that
the calculated 't' value falls below the critical threshold. Consequently, it can be concluded
that the null hypothesis is rejected at the 0.05 significance level. The findings suggest that
there is a significant difference between the mean scores of boys and girls in the sample
population.
