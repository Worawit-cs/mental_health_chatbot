GAD-7 Important Notes and Scoring
The GAD-7 is based on the diagnostic criteria for GAD described in DSM-IV. However, the GAD-7 is also sensitive
to severity of symptoms of social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder.
Please note: This questionnaire is designed for use by a health professional. Since the questionnaires rely on patient
self-report, all responses should be verified by the clinician and a definitive diagnosis made on clinical grounds,
taking into account how well the patient understood the questionnaire, as well as other relevant information from the
patient (e.g., presence of DSM-IV GAD symptoms). A diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder should not be
made based on GAD-7 scores alone.
A score of 10 or greater indicates that further evaluation is required.
Scoring Criteria: Total score (adding all the numbers) provides a possible score from 0-21.
GAD-7 Total Score Symptom Range
0-4 Minimal Anxiety
5-9 Mild Anxiety
10-14 Moderate Anxiety
15-21 Severe Anxiety
