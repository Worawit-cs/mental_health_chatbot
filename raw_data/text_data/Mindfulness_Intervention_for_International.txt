Abstract
Background: Student mobility across borders poses challenges to health systems at the university
and country levels. International students suffer from stress more than their local peers, however,
do not seek help or underutilize existing help offers. Some barriers to help-seeking among
international students are insufficient information regarding the health offers, stigma, and
language, which might be overcome via culturally adapted internet and mobile-based interventions
(IMI).
Method: A randomized controlled feasibility trial with a parallel design assessed the feasibility
and potential efficacy of an online mindfulness intervention adapted for international university
students. Participants were randomized into either an adapted online mindfulness intervention
(StudiCareM-E) (IG, n = 20) or a waitlist control group (WL, n = 20). Participants were assessed at
baseline (t0) and eight-week post-randomization (t1). The feasibility of StudiCareM-E was
evaluated regarding intervention adherence, client satisfaction, and potential negative effects. The
potential efficacy of StudiCareM-E was measured by means of the level of mindfulness, perceived
stress, depression, anxiety, presenteeism, and wellbeing. Efficacy outcomes were evaluated with
regression models on the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample (n = 40), adjusting for the baseline values.
Results: Participants’ formative feedback suggested improvements in the content of the IMI. There
were no crucial negative effects compared to WL. Assessment dropout was 35% (IG: 50%: WL: 20%),

and intervention dropout was 60%. StudiCareM-E yielded significant improvements in mindfulness
(β = .34), well-being (β = .37), and anxiety (β = -.42) compared to WL.
Conclusion: StudiCareM-E might be used among culturally diverse international student
populations to improve their well-being. Future studies might carefully inspect the extent of the
adaptation needs of their target group and design their interventions accordingly.

Highlights
• International students suffer from more stress compared to their local peers but rarely
seek help.
• Internet interventions can be adapted to cater to the needs of culturally diverse
international students.
• The adapted internet intervention for international students offers great potential to
improve psychological outcomes.
Starting university after high school is a challenging time. University students experience
stress due to financial issues, love life, and family relationships (Karyotaki et al., 2020),
and sexual identity (Rentería et al., 2021). Exposure to these stressors might result in
developing a mental health problem or low academic functioning, even dropping out of
university (Athira et al., 2020; Bantjes et al., 2021; Bruffaerts et al., 2018). Prevalence of
mental health problems among university students assessed from eight countries, and
19 universities, resulted in 35% of student participants (N = 13.984) having at least one
mental health problem (i.e. anxiety, mood, or substance use), with Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD) (21.2% lifetime prevalence, 18.5% 12-month prevalence) being the most
common and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) the second most common (18.6%
lifetime prevalence, 16.7% 12-month prevalence) (Auerbach et al., 2018). The burden
from mental health problems comprises 45% of the overall disease burden among 10-24-
year-olds (Gore et al., 2011). Moreover, the majority of mental health problems over
the lifetime first develop before the age of 24, which makes this time of university
crucial to screen for mental health problems and provide prevention and/or treatment
opportunities (Jones, 2013).
Students who cross borders to study are increasing in Europe, especially in Germany,
where the number of international students substantially increased from 312.000 in 2018
to 416.437 in 2020 (Eurostat, 2018; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2021). International students
encounter similar life challenges as students studying in their home country but are also
faced with additional stressors that may trigger homesickness (Akhtar & Kröner-Herwig,
2015), problems in socializing with the local students (Byrne et al., 2019), adapting
to a new country, lifestyle, and language, and a new academic culture and customs

(Forbes-Mewett & Sawyer, 2016; Yu & Wright, 2016). Studying abroad, while mostly
associated with positive experiences, can cause some challenges and result in mental
burden (Orygen, 2020; Stokes et al., 2021).
Even though university students suffer from psychological distress, their help-seek­
ing behavior is very limited (Auerbach et al., 2016). This can be attributed to various
factors, such as not being familiar with the symptoms of or the help options for mental
health problems, social stigma, social and cultural influences (e.g. traditional masculine
ideals) (Lynch et al., 2018), limited access to professional help via university, and finan­
cial problems (Auerbach et al., 2016; Gulliver et al., 2010; Orygen, 2020). Although their
psychological stress level is higher compared to students of the host country (Lu et
al., 2014), international students are less likely to seek help from a counseling service
(Lu et al., 2014; Stokes et al., 2021), have lower mental health literacy, and less positive
attitudes towards seeking help (Clough et al., 2019). Some barriers which are specific to
international students might be related to cultural backgrounds where symptom severity
is underestimated, hesitation because of their family’s reaction, and language barrier (Lu
et al., 2014). In general, cultural influences play an important role in attitudes toward
mental health and help-seeking (Hudak et al., 2018). Furthermore, international students
who reach out to a counseling service fail to utilize psychological help services, e.g. not
attending the necessary number of sessions, and even benefit less from it, compared to
local students who utilized these services (Stokes et al., 2021), and drop out of the treat­
ment prematurely (Nilsson et al., 2004). In summary, there is a persistent discrepancy
between mental health needs and actual help-seeking behavior among international stu­
dents. Therefore, it is critical to offer appropriate psychological help to this particularly
vulnerable sub-group of the student population (Teegen & Conrad-Popova, 2021).
Barriers to help-seeking could be overcome by an easily accessible offer via deliver­
ing psychological health interventions online. Internet- and mobile-based interventions
(IMI) have the advantage of being independent of time and place, ability to reach pop­
ulations otherwise hard to reach, offering interventions to treat and prevent various
psychological problems, and are cost-effective (Ebert et al., 2018). Likewise, IMI have
proven to be effective in university student populations with small to moderate effects
in decreasing psychological symptoms (Harrer et al., 2019). Provided as guided IMI they
could work as effectively as face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (Carlbring et al.,
2018). The limited number of studies that targeted international students’ wellbeing via
offering an IMI resulted in improved mental health (Kanekar et al., 2010), reduction
of sleep difficulties (Spanhel, Burdach, et al., 2021), more help-seeking, and reduced
stigma (Clough et al., 2020). However, issues around the adherence and uptake of IMI
still persist (Batterham et al., 2021; Molloy et al., 2021). IMI can also aim at treating
mental health problems, e.g. depression, but can also be utilized in promoting health
skills (Galante et al., 2018; Sevilla-Llewellyn-Jones et al., 2018). An example of a helpful
skill to promote mental health and well-being is mindfulness. Mindfulness refers to

experiencing the present and being aware of life with acceptance and self-compassion,
without any judgment (Slom & Kabat-Zinn, 2020). Mindfulness-based interventions could
be delivered successfully online (Jayawardene et al., 2017), and have been tested and
found effective among students (Hall et al., 2018; Mak et al., 2015; Nguyen-Feng et al.,
2017) and general and clinical populations (Querstret et al., 2018; Sevilla-Llewellyn-Jones
et al., 2018). A recent meta-analysis of RCTs of online mindfulness interventions resulted
in significant small to moderate effects on depression (g = .34), anxiety (g = .26), mindful­
ness (g = .40), stress (g = .44), well-being (g = .22). These effects were maintained in
the follow-up for depression (g = .25) and anxiety (g = .23) (Sommers-Spijkerman et al.,
2021). Mindfulness interventions can be seen as less threatening due to their associations
with well-being and calmness, instead of interventions targeting mental health problems
which might impede help-seeking due to stigma (Clement et al., 2015). Mindfulness
interventions could also be adapted to meet the needs of a specific target group. For
instance, the delivery method could be changed (e. g. intervention taking place in a
cultural community center), the facilitator, researcher/therapist, could be matched with
a target group’s cultural background, a culturally congruent recruitment strategy could
be adopted, the content could be changed, culturally appropriate analogies could be used
(Watson-Singleton et al., 2019), dispelling myths around mindfulness (Castellanos et al.,
2020; Cotter & Jones, 2020; Lawlor, 2022), storytelling, and community input can be uti­
lized (Le & Gobert, 2015). However, the adaptation of online mindfulness interventions is
rarely defined in detail in the previous literature, but systematic adaptation frameworks
are emerging (Loucks et al., 2022; Spanhel, Balci, et al., 2021). Moreover, mindfulness
interventions’ transdiagnostic nature and growing popularity in recent years via adver­
tising as a self-care instrument make them more appealing. They could therefore serve
as an alternative way to reach out to international students with various psychological
problems.
Objectives
In order to explore the feasibility and possible efficacy of the online mindfulness inter­
vention adapted for international students, StudiCare Mindfulness – English version
(StudiCareM-E), the following research questions will be explored.
Research questions:
1. Are the study methods feasible and transferable to a future, large-scale randomized
controlled trial with regard to implementation and the chosen recruitment strategy?
2. What are the levels of intervention satisfaction, adherence, negative effects, and
acceptance?
3. Does the internet-based intervention StudiCareM-E have a potential effect on
increasing mindfulness levels compared to a waitlist control group?

4. What effects does the StudiCareM-E have on measures of psychological well-being
(depression, stress, anxiety, well-being, and presenteeism) in comparison to the
waitlist control group?
Method
This is a two-armed, randomized controlled trial of parallel design (registered in the
German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00017507) comparing guided IMI StudiCareM-E
(IG) with a waitlist control group (WL) receiving the unguided version of the same IMI
eight weeks post-randomization. The study was approved by the ethics committee of
Ulm University (Number 413/18) and followed the CONSORT guidelines for feasibility
trials (Eldridge et al., 2016).
Participants
The eligibility criteria for participating in the study were: being at least 18 years old,
having a low to moderate level of mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory FMI <
37), having internet access, having student status, ability to read and understand English
(all self-reported), giving consent to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included
being in a mindfulness course, having a higher than moderate mindfulness level, and
being in psychotherapy.
Procedure
Participants were recruited from July 2019 to March 2020. The recruitment was done
through regular emails sent out twice a year from the cooperating universities of the
StudiCare project (Harrer et al., 2018; Küchler et al., 2019) in Germany, Switzerland,
and Austria, complemented by study posters and further on-site recruitment strategies
at the Ulm University. The email consisted of information regarding various trainings
that are offered within the StudiCare project at a given time along with an invitation
to participate in the training. Additional emails were sent to universities’ international
offices in the above-mentioned countries. Potential participants received a direct link to
the study website to register and were then invited to the screening via email. After
screening and providing informed consent, participants were invited to complete the
initial survey. Participants were randomized into either intervention (immediate access)
or waitlist (access eight weeks post-randomization) control group. Afterward, they got
access to online training.
Randomization
Randomization was carried out by an independent researcher who was not involved
in the Studicare Project. A simple randomization list applying block sizes of two and

four by a computer generator was created using Sealed Envelope1. 20 participants were
allocated to each study arm with a 1:1 ratio, making a total of 40 participants.
Intervention
Based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Hayes et al., 1999) and stress manage­
ment principles (Kaluza, 2015), StudiCareM-E consists of seven weekly modules and two
booster sessions; each module takes approximately 50 minutes to complete (Küchler
et al., 2020; Schultchen et al., 2020). StudiCareM-E has been shown to yield a high
effect among German-speaking students compared to a waitlist control group (d = 1.37)
(Küchler et al., 2022).
Participants were advised to complete one module per week. Participants who com­
pleted seven modules received access to booster sessions one and two, four and 12
weeks, respectively, after completion of the last module. The focus of the intervention
is on promoting mindfulness and psychological flexibility. The content is delivered on a
content management platform (www.minddistrict.com) via text, images, audio files, and
interactive quizzes. Participants were able to access the online platform Minddistrict
at all times. Every module aims at improving a different skill, such as identifying
stress-inducing thinking patterns and getting in touch with values in life. At the end
of each module, homework is assigned to the participant, and at the beginning of the
next module, the participants are encouraged to monitor their progress. Each module
introduces a different kind of meditation exercise, e.g. body scan, interoception. A mind­
fulness journal and a summary of the respective module were available at the end of each
module. Content and introduced mindfulness exercises of each module are presented in
Table 1.
Adaptation of the Intervention
Cultural adaptation of the intervention was based on Resnicow’s theory of cultural sensi­
tivity in health behavior intervention development, which has two dimensions: surface
and deep structure. According to the theory, interventions could be altered to fit the
target groups’ needs and features in these levels where surface-level alterations concern
visible characteristics of the target population such as language, music, food choices, and
clothing, whereas deep structure changes refer to counting intersecting effects of cultur­
al, social, historical and psychological influences on the target health behavior (Resnicow
et al., 2000). In this trial, surface structure changes were conducted to make the interven­
tion content more compatible with culturally diverse international students. Conducted
changes to the original German intervention represented in Table 2 based on Spanhel et
al.’s taxonomy of cultural adaptation of IMI for mental health problems (Spanhel, Balci,

et al., 2021). The taxonomy consists of various components that researchers can adapt in
order to make IMI more appropriate to the new target group: ten components related to
the content of the intervention, four methodological, and three procedural components.
Changes were implemented in content components (e.g. stigmatization of mental health
problems), methodological (e.g. guidance in English), and procedural domains (e.g. using
a theoretical framework for adaptation). For English-speaking international students,
the intervention content of StudiCare-Mindfulness (Küchler et al., 2020; Schultchen et
al., 2020) was translated to English and certain aspects (e.g. language barrier, different
education systems) changed in accordance with student life and stress sources.

Guidance
At the end of each module, intervention group (IG) participants received feedback from
an e-coach, who was a trained psychologist (SB). Each feedback consisted of a review
of their progress in the intervention and encouragement to continue the intervention
such as “Dear …., thanks for sending your third module! I am happy that you are
working actively on the program.” and continues with a review of completed exercises
“The second task was to think about stressful situations in the past and what helped
you to cope with stress. You wrote that … was very helpful for you.” and end with
an encouragement to continue with the upcoming module “I wish you a relaxed week
with many attentive moments and a lot of fun while working on module 4.”. Moreover,
reminder emails were sent to the participants who did not complete the modules in
time. The e-coach was instructed to take no longer than 15 minutes per feedback, which
results in a planned e-coaching time of max. 105 minutes per participant for all seven
modules.

SMS Coach
In IMI, receiving SMS messages may contribute to adherence and intervention effect
(Lentferink et al., 2017; Webb et al., 2010). Consequently, a voluntary text message coach
was implemented and offered to each participant. These motivational SMS messages
were set to be sent every two days, throughout the intervention. They consisted of
motivational texts to promote the use of learned skills, be mindful throughout the day,
and continue the intervention, such as “‘The true art of life is to see beauty in the daily.’
What beautiful moment did you experience today?”, and “‘Every moment is absolute,
alive and meaningful.’ – What was your mindful moment today? When was the least
mindful moment? How did you feel then?”.
Control Group
Control group participants received a document summarizing the alternative support
offers via email after the randomization. Participants of the control group got access to
the unguided version of the StudiCareM-E eight weeks after the randomization.
Assessment and Outcomes
Assessments were conducted via an online platform, www.unipark.de, at baseline (t0)
and eight weeks post-randomization (t1), blinding of outcome assessment was not possi­
ble. All data were self-reported.
Acceptability was measured via participants’ attitudes towards the IMI, their forma­
tive feedback, and satisfaction with the intervention and its potential negative effects.
Open-ended questions at the end of each module were extracted from the Minddistrict
platform. These outcomes are reported descriptively.
The primary efficacy outcome of this study is Mindfulness level. Secondary outcomes
are Anxiety, Stress, Depression, Personality, Well-being, Presenteeism, Client Satisfac­
tion, Risks and Negative Effects of Psychotherapy, and Acceptance and Adherence ques­
tions.
Mindfulness was assessed using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), which
consists of 14 items measuring mindfulness on a 4-point scale ranging from 1= rarely to
4 = almost always, and showed high internal consistency (α = 0.84) (Walach et al., 2006).
Anxiety was measured with a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire
(GAD-7) on a scale from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day and has high internal
consistency (α = 0.92) (Spitzer et al., 2006).
Stress outcome was measured with 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (0 = never to 4 =
very often), which also showed good reliability (α = 0.77) (Warttig et al., 2013).
Depression was measured with an 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, where high
reliability was observed (α = 0.89) and rated on a scale of 0 = not at all to 3 = early every
day (Kroenke et al., 2001).

Balci, Küchler, Ebert, & Baumeister 11
WHO-5 well-being index was used to assess subjective well-being on a scale of 0 =
at no time to 5 = all of the time, which showed high internal consistency, α > 0.80
(Lara-Cabrera et al., 2022; Spanhel, Burdach, et al., 2021; Topp et al., 2015).
Presenteeism, i.e. loss of productivity was measured with the Presenteeism Scale
for Students. The subscale of work impairment was used to assess the degree of pre­
senteeism, which consist of 10 items; with total scores ranging from 10 to 50, higher
scores represent a higher degree of presenteeism and showed high reliability, α = 0.90
(Matsushita et al., 2011).
Eight weeks after randomization, in addition to the above-mentioned tools, assess­
ments of intervention satisfaction were done using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire
(total scores range from 8 to 32) adapted to Internet-based Interventions (Boß et al.,
2016). Negative effects of Psychotherapy were measured using INEP (Inventory for the
Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy) adapted to online interventions with
22 items describing possible negative effects that may occur during the online interven­
tion and whether they are attributed to the intervention (Ladwig et al., 2014). The results
of this scale are presented descriptively.
Sample Size
In order to determine the sample size for this feasibility trial, we followed the recommen­
dation by Whitehead et al. (2016), resulting in a sample size of 15 participants per trial
arm for pilot testing of a potential confirmatory trial with 90% power and two-sided
5% significance. A meta-analysis resulted in an effect size of 0.40 for mindfulness-based
IMI, therefore we assumed a higher effect size, i.e. 0.50 because this trial is guided
(Sommers-Spijkerman et al., 2021). With the expectation of a 30% dropout, we aimed at
reaching a sample size of 40 in total.
Statistical Analyses
IBM SPSS/version 26 and R Studio were used in statistical analyses with a s ignificance
level of α = 0.05. Descriptive statistics (means, SDs for continuous outcomes, and percen­
tages for categorical variables) were used to summarize the demographic and feasibility
data for study groups. Linear regression models were used to investigate potential group
differences, where baseline values were used as covariates in all models (dummy coded
predictor: IG = 1). For each outcome, we reported standardized regression coe fficients
and corresponding 95% CI and adjusted R2 values.
Data analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle (ITT). Missing data were
imputed based on multivariate imputation by chained equations to create 20 completed
datasets with 15 iterations. Predictive mean matching was applied as an imputation
model.

Results
Feasibility
Recruitment and Participants
Recruitment lasted from May 2019 until March 2020. One hundred and twenty-three
participants were invited to the screening. n = 46 did not complete the screening. Out
of 77 screened, 37 were excluded due to the following reasons: not providing informed
consent (n = 18), having a high FMI score (> 37) (n = 10), being in psychotherapy (n = 6),
being in another mindfulness training (n = 1), not being a student (n = 1), and providing
an inaccessible email address (n = 1). n = 40 provided consent and were randomized to
either IG or WL groups, see Figure 1.
The mean age of the participants was M = 26.23 (SD = 4.51), 77.5% were female,
37.5% could speak the host country’s language well (>B2 level), and 97% speak English
well (>B2 level). The study level of the participants varied: out of 40, 24 studied in a
master's program, nine were in a bachelor's program, six were in a Ph.D. program, and
one participant was doing an internship semester. The baseline characteristics of the
participants are tabulated in Table 3.
Out of 40 randomized participants, 26 (IG: 50%; WL: 80%) completed the t1, resulting
in a study dropout of 35%. There was a baseline difference between assessment dropouts
and non-dropouts, where non-dropouts had slightly more stress (mean difference = 1.68).
Intervention Adherence
Out of 20 participants randomized into the IG, eight participants (40%) completed at least
five core modules (four of them completed the seven modules), whereas four did not
finish the first module. Three completed the first module, two participants completed
two modules, two participants three modules and one participant completed the fourth
module, see Figure 2. All the intervention completers also completed the post-randomi­
zation assessment. No reasons were reported regarding no uptake of the intervention.
The average intervention duration among the intervention completers was 60 days, five
of them completed the intervention within 60 days. Eight participants signed up for
the SMS coach. Based on 10 participants’ answers to the open-ended questions on t1,
participants practiced mindfulness on average 3.6 days weekly during the intervention.
On these days, they spent an average of 18.3 minutes practicing mindfulness.
Acceptability
In order to assess the acceptability of the StudiCareM-E among the participants, we used
various sources: open-ended questions by the end of the post-intervention measurement,
treatment satisfaction measured via CSQ, and potential negative effects measured with
INEP-On, and formative user feedback extracted via the online platform of Minddistrict.

their everyday life. Additionally, they scored 8.9 on their likelihood of participating in a
mindfulness-based intervention in the future.
In terms of treatment satisfaction, the ITT data on CSQ, the overall satisfaction with
the intervention was M = 25.4, SD = 2.2. All of the completers would definitely or
probably recommend the intervention to a friend and 90% reported that the intervention
met their needs, 70% would like to receive such intervention if they need help in the
future, and 80% found the intervention satisfactory.
Potential negative effects of StudiCareM-E were evaluated with INEP-On in t1. Based
on the results from INEP-On, six IG participants reported seven negative effects caused
by the IMI in the following domains: anxiety about finding insurance (n = 1), increased
financial worries (n = 1), data security (n = 1), feeling forced to do the exercises of
the intervention despite not wanting to do it (n = 3), difficulties in making important
decisions without asking the therapist (n = 2), found training or the formulations of the
e-Coach contained hurtful statements (n = 1) and feeling that being made fun of in the
intervention material (n = 1). One participant reported negative effects on each of the
above-mentioned domains, whereas the rest of the five participants reported negative ef­
fects on a single domain. Of the five, two reported feeling forced into finishing modules,
and three reported neglecting hobby/social contacts. No suicidal ideation was reported
caused by the IMI. The magnitude of all negative effects reported was low to moderate.
According to the formative feedback extracted from the Minddistrict platform, all of
the modules were well-liked, scoring ≥ 7 out of a 10-point scale, the most liked being
the last module (Module 7: Body and Mind). Recommendations included adding more

meditation exercises, and decreasing the number of text fields.
Efficacy Outcomes
Descriptive statistics of the study outcomes at the baseline are represented in Table 3.
There were no baseline differences observed. Controlling for baseline mindfulness levels,
IG participants showed improvement in mindfulness at the T1 compared to WL (β = 0.34,
95% CI [0.06, 0.63], p < .05; Adjusted R2 = 0.13). Moreover, anxiety was improved among
IG participants, compared to WL (β = -0.42, 95% CI [-0.72, -0.11], p < .05; Adjusted R2 =
0.14) as well as Well-being (β = 0.37, 95% CI [0.07, 0.68], p < .05; Adjusted R2 = 0.13). The
effect estimates (β, CI, and p values) of the rest of the secondary outcomes are presented

Discussion
This RCT evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a cross-cultural
version of a mindfulness-based IMI among international university students studying in
Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The initial results suggest that the adapted version
of StudiCareM-E was feasible, perceived acceptable, and offered benefits in psychological
outcomes compared to WL, and minor negative effects were reported among IG partici­
pants. Our preliminary results might guide a powered definitive trial. Working examples
and recommendations for improvement are presented in the following paragraphs.
Our recruitment strategy included sending emails via cooperating universities, using
social media channels of university groups/student clubs, and hanging hard copy posters
around the Ulm University campus. We aimed at reaching a total of 40 participants,
Clinical Psychology in Europe

which took 11 months. The length of the recruitment is longer than a previous digital
sleep intervention for international students, where n = 81 was reached in seven months
(Spanhel, Burdach, et al., 2021). One reason for this might be the length and transdiag­
nostic nature of our intervention. Moreover, international student offices could be better
utilized to aid the recruitment process in a future trial. With the above-mentioned
strategy, we reached a population of mostly female (77%) participants, aiming for a
post-graduate degree (82.5%), e.g. master's and Ph.D., which was higher than DAAD’s
2019/20 report of international students studying for a postgraduate degree in Germany
(52%) (DAAD, 2020).
A post-randomization assessment dropout rate of 35% was detected. Half of the
IG and 20% of the WL failed to do the post-randomization assessment. This rate is
in accordance with previous mindfulness IMI among students (Lahtinen et al., 2023).
It is no surprise to have fewer dropouts in a waitlist control condition because the
participants of this condition got access to the intervention only after completing the
post-randomization assessment. In order to avoid dropouts, we sent out six reminder
emails to participants who did not complete this assessment. However, the success of
these measures was limited. Future trials might include reminder SMS or phone calls to
decrease the dropout rate.
The intervention adherence rate among IG participants was 40%. This rate is in
line with a recent meta-analysis of online mindfulness interventions conducted with
students and non-student populations, in which adherence rates ranged from 35 to 92%
(Sommers-Spijkerman et al., 2021). Although guided IMI correlated with higher rates of
adherence (Treanor et al., 2021; Zarski et al., 2016), this was not the case in our trial.
According to a review, some factors related to an increase in adherence to IMI are the
female gender, being in the control group, having time flexibility to do the intervention,
computer literacy, guidance, and depth of personalized feedback to increase s elf-efficacy
(Beatty & Binnion, 2016). Although our sample embodied some of these factors, e.g.
guidance, others could be improved. Program content seems to be a decisive factor in
adherence. Credibility, positive perceptions of the intervention content, personalization
of the intervention team (e.g. providing a photo of the team), and intensity (e.g. too
long/short and/or being too generic) of the content play a role in adherence (Beatty &
Binnion, 2016). The inclusion of some persuasive design aspects might aid adherence as
well (Baumeister et al., 2019). As mentioned by the participants as well, computer-human
dialogue support, e.g. audio and visual content, and social support, e.g. competition,
categories can be improved in a future definitive trial.
One specific component of this trial was that we adapted our intervention to a
culturally diverse group of international students. This diversity of the target group
might require novel intervention features beyond surface structure changes (Resnicow
et al., 2000) to increase adherence. Adapting an intervention for a group of participants
from various cultural, social, and financial backgrounds is particularly challenging, and

naturally, offering intervention content as common as possible to be able to appeal to
the majority is demanding. Therefore, one should carefully inspect all the parameters
and make sure that the cultural adaptation of the IMI adds a substantial benefit to its
target group. In this context, evidence of cultural adaptations’ substantial benefits is still
inconclusive. Based on a recent meta-analysis, cultural adaptation of health promotion
IMI might not be worth the considerable amount of effort because such adaptions do
not seem to yield better effectiveness compared to active and passive controls (Balci et
al., 2022). However, a previous review suggested that culturally adapted face-to-face and
online interventions resulted in reducing depression and anxiety (Harper Shehadeh et
al., 2016). Moreover, cultural adaptions are poorly reported in existing literature, which
makes it difficult to compare across studies and draw definitive conclusions (Balci et
al., 2022). The next step should include comparing an adapted IMI to a non-adapted
intervention. Such dismantling trials could provide insights into whether cultural adapta­
tion processes are actually beneficial. In a recent trial, a non-culturally adapted sleep
IMI yielded beneficial effects for culturally diverse international student groups (Spanhel,
Burdach, et al., 2021). This might bring out the idea that some intervention contents
might not significantly benefit from an elaborate adaptation process, especially for low
threshold interventions (Böttche et al., 2021; Cuijpers et al., 2018; Spanhel, Burdach, et
al., 2021). This trend emerged in our results as well, where we only realized surface-level
adaptations (Resnicow et al., 2000) and still found potential effectiveness. More impor­
tantly, IMI have different mechanisms of change, therefore a detailed cultural adaptation
might be beneficial for a certain IMI content or delivery, but not for all (Domhardt et
al., 2021; Heim & Kohrt, 2019). In a review, most of the culturally adapted interventions
did not modify their core contents but included core additions and delivery methods
to make the intervention more acceptable to the new target group while ensuring the
fidelity of the original intervention (Chu & Leino, 2017). For mindfulness-based IMI,
valued living, cognitive fusion, present moment awareness, and acceptance are effective
mediators among college students (Levin, Haeger, Pierce, & Twohig, 2017; Viskovich &
Pakenham, 2020). Some of these mediators are part of the universal human condition,
therefore, might not even need any adaptation. Lastly, acculturation might play a role in
attitudes toward seeking mental health (Lu et al., 2014). Therefore, acculturation levels
of international students might be considered when adapting or developing interventions
for this population.
Only six negative effects were reported and these were low to mild in extent.
Moreover, the IMI caused no suicidal ideation. Negative effects of psychotherapy are
expected and their reporting is increasing (Rozental et al., 2018). This result suggested
that StudiCareM-E is a rather safe intervention, and might be also administered in an
unguided form.
Furthermore, StudiCareM-E participants showed improvements in mindfulness, anxi­
ety, and well-being levels. Stress and depression scores did not reach significance. While

Balci, Küchler, Ebert, & Baumeister 19
a trend suggests possible beneficial effects regarding these outcomes, a powered defini­
tive trial would be necessary to confirm these effects since this trial was only powered
for feasibility. The mean effect sizes are higher than in a meta-analysis of online mind­
fulness interventions compared to a waitlist and no-treatment controls (Spijkerman et
al., 2016). However, trials with waitlist control groups tend to yield higher effect sizes
(van Agteren et al., 2021), thus in order to validate the StudiCareM-E’s efficacy, research
should initially test this in a powered trial with more follow-up points, and compare it to
treatment as usual, a placebo control group or active controls.
Like any other, this trial is not free from limitations. Firstly, our sample mostly
consisted of female participants, therefore our results cannot be generalized to male
or non-binary populations. However, this is a common trend in psychological interven­
tions. Secondly, a major limitation of this trial was grouping international students
from various backgrounds and living situations under the label of international students,
consequently masking potential differences among them. Thirdly, our sample consisted
of participants with diverse cultural backgrounds. According to a meta-analysis of 99
studies, it was found that studies with more homogenous participants in terms of cultural
background yielded larger effect sizes (Soto et al., 2018). Even though culturally adapted,
this intervention was in English. People prefer to have a unity of language with their
mental health care provider (Villalobos et al., 2016), and providing interventions in the
chosen language of the client is a significant predictor of better outcomes (Soto et al.,
2018). Despite this fact, participants assessed the language of the intervention as being
easy to understand. However, still providing the intervention content in the participant’s
chosen language might increase the efficacy of the intervention further. Therefore, a
future definitive trial might consider offering the same intervention in different languag­
es to choose from and might adapt the intervention based on parsimonious social and
cultural features. Fourth, this feasibility trial used a WL control group. As expected, trials
of culturally adapted face-to-face mental health interventions with a WL group resulted
in higher effect sizes, compared to an active control condition (d = 0.53 vs d = 0.47) (Soto
et al., 2018). This is also true for IMI (Sommers-Spijkerman et al., 2021). Fifth, due to
high dropout and low adherence, we were able to collect less qualitative and quantitative
data to inform acceptability and potential efficacy. Assessment dropout was 35% in total,
which is in accordance with the previous research (Nilsson et al., 2004). Possible reasons
for this may include a lack of monetary incentives, procrastination, and the typical work­
load of student life. In order to tackle potential bias arising from differential dropout, we
multiply imputed our data with the assumption of missing at random (Bell et al., 2013),
and added baseline values as covariates in all regression models. However, there was a
baseline difference between assessment dropout and non-dropouts where, participants
who completed the post-randomization assessment had a slightly higher stress level in
the beginning of the study, therefore might be more motivated, needed a medium to deal
with the stress, and had more place to grow. Lastly, this feasibility trial reached a limited

sample size; therefore, the initial efficacy results should be interpreted with caution. An
inspection of sustainability of intervention effect beyond post-treatment is warranted.
Conclusion
Online interventions to decrease stress and improve the well-being of international
university students seem to have great potential, whereas face-to-face offers are not
often utilized and benefited in limitation. Despite being presented to vastly culturally
diverse student groups, StudiCareM-E yielded beneficial results with good acceptability
and non-crucial negative effects. A future definitive RCT might offer a more robust
efficacy and potential moderator and mediator effects.
