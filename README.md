#About Project
Project Title: Mental Health Chatbot
Abstract

This project originates from the increasing interaction between users and AI-based mental health advisors or emotional support systems. Observing this growing trend, we aimed to apply the theoretical and practical knowledge gained from the course 204203 to develop an intelligent chatbot capable of assisting users in managing their mental well-being through empathetic and responsive conversation.

Objectives

The main objective of this project is to design and implement an AI-driven chatbot that can engage in meaningful dialogue related to mental health, providing users with a safe and supportive environment to express their emotions or seek preliminary guidance. The project also aims to explore how modern AI techniques can be used to enhance conversational accuracy, personalization, and reliability.

Technical Implementation

The system integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the chatbot’s contextual understanding and ensure more accurate responses based on relevant data sources. Additionally, JSON Schema is utilized for defining structured data formats, allowing efficient validation and communication between components in the application pipeline.

Tools and Development Environment

Development Tools: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Git, GitHub, Streamlit Cloud

Technology Stack: Python, LiteLLM, LangChain, Streamlit, CSS

Models Used: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini

Conclusion

By combining advanced AI frameworks, data structuring techniques, and conversational design principles, the Mental Health Chatbot project demonstrates how academic knowledge from 204203 can be effectively applied to real-world innovation. The integration of RAG and JSON Schema further enhances the chatbot’s capability, ensuring both technical robustness and meaningful human–AI interaction.
