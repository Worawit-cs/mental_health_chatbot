Analyze the user's free-form text input to:

1. Predict the user's emotional or mental state, choosing from the following (or indicate "unknown" if inconclusive):
   - suicidal ideation
   - depressive symptoms
   - anxiety or panic
   - stress or burnout
   - emotionally neutral
   - positive state
   - unknown

   Justify your classification by referencing specific linguistic or semantic cues in the input.

2. Extract context-relevant keywords or phrases that may help describe the user's life circumstances or social environment, such as:
   - education (e.g., university, exams)
   - employment (e.g., boss, workload, unemployment)
   - family (e.g., parents, siblings)
   - relationships (e.g., friends, partner, breakup)
   - isolation or support systems
   - any other meaningful situational cues

You should reason beyond explicit terms â€” infer implied meanings where appropriate. Use psychological and emotional reasoning, even if the text is metaphorical or vague.
